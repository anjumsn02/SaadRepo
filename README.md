# WebCrawler

This is a Python based webcrawler that I have created for one of my projects. With a given URL, this program creates spiders to crawl the page
and gather up all the links found on the page and store them into a textfile. It then reads the text file and stores the websites into a database
where they can be used by my search engine designed in HTML, CSS, and PHP for later use.
